### Hi! Welcome to my GitHub Page

I am postdoc at the UniversitÃ¤t Greifswald in Greifswald, Germany. 

There I am a mathematician primarily interested in understanding the role of <em>equalities</em> in mathematics, otherwise known as <bf>homotopy theory</bf>.

I believe formalization of matheamtics via proof assistants can be an important step towards better understanding homotopy theory. As a result I have now commenced various formalization projects, including contributions to <a href="https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath">Coq UniMath</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rzk-lang">Rzk</a>. In particular I am currently focused oon the following formalization projects:

<ol>
  <li> <b>Double Categories:</b> I am working on a <a href="https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/tree/master/UniMath/Bicategories/DoubleCategories">formalization of double categories</a> in Coq UniMath (jointly with <a href="https://github.com/benediktahrens">Benedikt Ahrens</a>, <a href="https://github.com/paigenorth">Paige North</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nmvdw">Niels van der Weide</a>).</li>
  <li> <b>Formalization of âˆž-Cosmoi:</b> I have been contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/emilyriehl/infinity-cosmos">formalization of âˆž-cosmoi</a> due to <a href="https://math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/elements.pdf">Riehl and Verity</a> via the proof assistant <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4">Lean</a>.</li>
  <li> <b>Simplicial Type Theory:</b> I am contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/rzk-lang/sHoTT">formalization of simplicial type theory</a>, as defined by <a href="https://higher-structures.math.cas.cz/api/files/issues/Vol1Iss1/RiehlShulman">Riehl & Shulman</a>.</li>
</ol>

More details my formalization work can be found in the repositories below!

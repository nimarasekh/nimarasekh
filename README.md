### Hi! Welcome to my GitHub Page

I am postdoc at the Universität Greifswald in Greifswald, Germany, in the research group of [Konrad Waldorf](http://math.konradwaldorf.de/) and [Matthias Ludewig](https://www.matthias-ludewig.eu/). 

There I am a mathematician primarily interested in understanding the role of *equalities* in mathematics, otherwise known as **homotopy theory**.

I believe formalization of matheamtics via proof assistants can be an important step towards better understanding homotopy theory. As a result, I have contributed to various formalization projects, including contributions to [Coq UniMath](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath) and [Rzk](https://github.com/rzk-lang). My GitHub repo contains content from both mathematics and computer science:

1. **Applied Category Theory:** In Winter 2025 I organized a seminar on applied category theory with many different [ideas](https://github.com/nimarasekh/act-WiSe25).
2. **Teaching Lean:** In Summer 2025 I taught an introductory course on Lean with a lot of [course material](https://github.com/nimarasekh/Formalization-SoSe25).
3. **Differential Cohomology** Throughout 2025 I have organizing a running a seminar on differential cohomology, gathering some [lecture notes](https://github.com/nimarasekh/DiffCoh-SoSe25).
4. **Formalization of Double Categories:** I contributed to the formalization of double category theory in [Rocq UniMath](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/tree/master/UniMath/Bicategories/DoubleCategories).

More general information about me and my work can be found on my [Academic Webpage](https://nimarasekh.github.io).
